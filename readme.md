## ChatGPT Extension

I'd like this extension:

- to consume the contents of the page I am viewing.
- summarise the page.
- prompt me to ask questions about it
- tell me how factual the information is likely to be

How will it work?

- You'll click a button and it will show a loading spinner while it processes the page
- It will then show the summary and reliability score in a window and give an input for you to ask questions
